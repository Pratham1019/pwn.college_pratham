# Hello Hackers

## Command History
The challenge asks you to open the terminal in the pwn.college DOJO and use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through the command history in the terminal and find the flag.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{AR53CryLFiuM0N1A05xFWad58e6.0lNzEzNxwCM0kDMzEzW}`

For solving this challenge, I pressed the up arrow key to view the previous command in the history, where the flag was already present.

```bash
<up arrow pressed>
the flag is pwn.college{AR53CryLFiuM0N1A05xFWad58e6.0lNzEzNxwCM0kDMzEzW}
pwn.college{AR53CryLFiuM0N1A05xFWad58e6.0lNzEzNxwCM0kDMzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
From this challenge, I learnt that the linux terminal saves our previous commands which can be accessed via up and down arrow keys.
