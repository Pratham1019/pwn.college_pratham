# Hello Hackers

## Intro to Arguments
Run Linux command in the terminal with arguments. The goal is to execute the hello command with argument as hackers to get the flag.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{AfftyRecpeHFnoA3FxkexmzmCWn.QX4YjM1wCM0kDMzEzW}`

For solving this challenge, I entered the command 'hello' with an argument 'hackers' in the terminal which successfully returned the flag.

```bash
hello hackers
pwn.college{AfftyRecpeHFnoA3FxkexmzmCWn.QX4YjM1wCM0kDMzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
From this challenge I learnt that commands in the linux terminal can even take in arguments or parameters.
