# Pondering Paths

## Program and absolute paths
The challenge asks you to open the terminal in the pwn.college DOJO and run the "run" program which is located inside the "challege" directory using the absolute path "/challenge/run" to get the flag. 

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{g_ElCyESCpv9Z5ZmGvJzh6PgqWJ.QX1QTN0wCM0kDMzEzW}`
For solving this challege, I executed the run program stored inside the challenge directory using its absolute path '/challenge/run' which sucessfully returned the flag.

```bash
/challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{g_ElCyESCpv9Z5ZmGvJzh6PgqWJ.QX1QTN0wCM0kDMzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
From this challenge, i learnt how to run a program located inside another directory using absolute pasths.
